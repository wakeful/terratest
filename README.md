Terratest is a Go library that makes it easier to write automated tests for your infrastructure code. It provides a
variety of helper functions and patterns for common infrastructure testing tasks, including:

- Testing Terraform code
- Testing Packer templates
- Testing Docker images
- Executing commands on servers over SSH
- Working with AWS APIs
- Working with Azure APIs
- Working with GCP APIs
- Working with Kubernetes APIs
- Testing Helm Charts
- Making HTTP requests
- Running shell commands
- And much more

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest@latest
```

Requires Go 1.26 or later. To lock to a specific release instead of `@latest`, see [Pinning a Terratest version](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/version-pinning/).

## Stability and versioning

Starting with v1.0.0, Terratest follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Breaking changes to the public API
only happen in major releases (e.g. v2.0.0).

Symbols renamed or replaced in v1 are kept with `// Deprecated:` annotations pointing at the new name; removals happen
in v2. Migrating from v0.x: see the [v1 migration guide](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/docs/migrating-to-v1/overview/).

**v1 maintenance.** With v2 in development, the v1 line has entered maintenance: it receives security fixes only,
delivered on the `v1` branch, until 12 months after v2.0.0 reaches general availability. v2 ships under new `/v2`
module paths, so pinned v1 consumers are unaffected. Upgrade on your own schedule.
